            Twitter, also known as X is one of the older modern social media that is still very popular today. 
            It differs from some other social media platforms as it allows users to post just text with no 
            image or video. It mainly connects the average person with public figures such as celebrities or 
            politicians and news outlets. A negative effect Twitter
            has on its users is its tendency to spread fake news. With today's monetization system on Twitter,
            many users participate in engagement farming without putting much thought into what they are posting.
            This is excacerbated by its retweet feature which allows tweets to go viral regardless of its validity.
